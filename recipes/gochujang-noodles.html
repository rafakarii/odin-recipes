        <li>toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 lime lime, cut into 4 wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together gochujang, 1/4 cup water, soy sauce, maple syrup, and lime juice in a bowl. Set sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add kale, 1/4 cup of the scallions, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly with tongs, until greens are just wilted and tender, and garlic and onions are glossy and almost translucent, about 2 minutes. Add sauce to greens and cook until slightly thickened and darkened in color, about 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked noodles and cook, until sauce is bubbling where it pools, about 2 to 3 minutes, gradually adding remaining 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if more sauce is needed to coat the noodles.</li>
        <li>Top with cucumber, remaining 1/4 cup scallions, and sesame seeds. Drizzle with sesame oil and serve warm with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
